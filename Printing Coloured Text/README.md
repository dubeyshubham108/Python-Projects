# Coloured Text In Pyton
Here we have used Colorama module of python for printing coloured text

The Colorama module offers three main formatting options: Fore, Back, and Style. These allow us to change the foreground or background text color and style. The colors available for the foreground and background are black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white.

Traditionally, printing full-colour text to the terminal is accomplished by a series of escape characters on Linux or OS X systems. However, this will not work for Windows operating systems.

For more detail about this module you can see the documentation of it here.
